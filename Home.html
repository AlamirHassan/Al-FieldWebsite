                      <p class="text-muted">Thanks to advances in the Internet, microelectronics, and telecommunications, computers and technology continue to be a very hot career category.
                        Computer systems design and information services are expanding rapidly. As cell phone companies improve their services, specialists in
                        microelectronics will be in demand. Tech-savvy workers will be hired to build better laptops, digital cameras, MP3s, PDAs, and satellites for radio
                        communications.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">The field of technology will be further driven by innovations such as advanced artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, in which scientists learn to
                        build futuristic gadgets atom by atom.</p>

                      <p class="text-muted">As the baby-boom generation ages, the demand for health care services is expected to increase dramatically. In fact, 15 of the 30 fastest-growing
                        careers in the country are health-related. Registered nurses currently lead the pack in terms of job opportunities, but openings for chiropractors,
                        veterinarians, and speech-language pathologists are also expected to increase.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">To help control costs, many tasks and procedures formerly performed by doctors and other high-level health care professionals are now being done
                        by assistants. As a result, job opportunities for dental assistants, physician assistants, and therapy aides are on the rise.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Stricter regulations and expanding services in health care will require more medical records specialists and health information technicians. Many of
                        these positions require only a two-year degree.</p>

                      <p class="text-muted">As the number of preschool-age children increases, so will the demand for public school teachers. Schools have been hiring more educational
                        paraprofessionals in recent years, and these positions often do not require an advanced degree. Paraprofessionals include teacher’s aides, special
                        education assistants, early childhood assistants, and library assistants.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Community and social services are expected to add jobs over the next few years as well because of the issues related to an aging population.</p>

                        technology.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Jobs in the arts and communications include graphic design, copywriting, advertising, broadcasting, and more. Many new jobs will be related to
                        professional, scientific, and technical services. “Corporations, hospitals, and schools all want animation, music, and interactive material for their
                        presentations,” says Marty Hasselbach, managing director of the Vancouver Film School in Canada. Also, as cable, the Web, satellite radio, electronic
                        games, and CD-ROM manufacturing has expanded, so has the need for actors, directors, and producers.</p>

                      <p class="text-muted">The manufacturing industry needs skilled tradespeople with technical know-how. Opportunities range from tool and die work to advanced robotics.
                        Finally, demand for truck drivers is expected to increase as industries rely on transportation services to deliver goods.</p>

                        years. Many of the positions will be related to scientific and technical consulting.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Accounting currently tops the list of careers with the most job offers for college grads, according to the National Association of Colleges and
                        Employers. Insurance is also expected to be a hot field, and more administrative assistants will be needed as corporations expand.</p>
                      <p class="text-muted">Families funding college educations and retirement savings are expected to rely more on personal financial advisors. And specialists in sales,
                        marketing, and advertising will continue to be in demand to keep services and products moving around the world. Two growth areas to keep an eye
                        on are e-commerce (selling over the Web) and forensic accounting (using accounting, auditing, and investigative skills in legal matters).</p>

                        computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting technology will have an edge when it comes to finding jobs. Homeland security demands, natural
                        disasters, and other challenges fuel the need for more civil engineers, who design and supervise the construction of roads, levees, tunnels, water
                        supply, and sewage systems.</p>
